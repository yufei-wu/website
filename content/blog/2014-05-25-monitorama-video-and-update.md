The Monitorama conference was a blast. If you did not get a chance to attend you can still checkout all the presentations
at [vimeo.com/monitorama](http://vimeo.com/monitorama).


In the end of the presentation I talk a little bit about the future for Grafana. Especially noteworthy is the fact that
I will be working full time on Grafana and related things by the end of July.

I apologize for the slow progress on pull requests. The last 3-4 weeks has been busy with preparing conferences (and the US trip) as well
as recovering from a pretty intense (no free/relax time) period as all work on Grafana is done in evenings and weekends. That should change in
the coming weeks but especially after July!

There are currently >150 open github issues. Almost all are for small/large enhancements and general improvement ideas. So there is so much fun stuff that can really make a big difference
in how we consume, visualize, share metrics. I am incredibly excited about the coming months.

If you are interested in Sponsoring Grafana development or collaborate in anyway please [let me know](mailto:torkel@grafana.org). After summer I will also be available for meetups, workshops and
Graphite coaching.

PS. [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.org) just launched a hosting service for InfluxDB and Grafana.
