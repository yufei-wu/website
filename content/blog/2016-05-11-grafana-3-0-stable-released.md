## Grafana.net

<img src="/assets/img/blog/v3.0/grafana_net_tour.png">

[Grafana.net](https://grafana.net) offers a central repository where the community can come together to discover, create and
share plugins (data sources, panels, apps) and dashboards.

We are also working on a hosted Graphite-compatible data source that will be optimized for use with Grafana.
It’ll be easy to combine your existing data source(s) with this OpenSaaS option. Finally, Grafana.net can
also be a hub to manage all your Grafana instances. You’ll be able to monitor their health and availability,
perform dashboard backups, and more.

Discovering and installing plugins is very quick and easy with Grafana 3.0 and [Grafana.net](https://grafana.net). Here
