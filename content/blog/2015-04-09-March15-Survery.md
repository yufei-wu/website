On March 1st 2015, we asked the Grafana community for a favor. We published a public
survey to solicit feedback on the current state of the product to better understand how
Grafana is being used and to weigh in on some new features we were considering.

The number and the quality of responses exceeded our expectations. Lots of really useful
feedback on what is missing and what could be better. There were also a lot of
gratifying compliments about how much everyone appreciate Grafana.
