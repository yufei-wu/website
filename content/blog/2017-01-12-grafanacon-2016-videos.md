Last November we held the second GrafanaCon. This time it was actually a real conference and not a glorified meetup (like GrafanaCon 2015).
It was a full two day conference, with over 200 attendees, 10 sponsors, 30 talks covering a diverse set
of topics from the Grafana ecosystem & user community. We also had an awesome and unique venue aboard the **Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum**
which is an aircraft carrier that has been converted into a museum highlighting US naval and air force history (it also has the spaceship Enterprise on board).

The event was big success, attendees and sponsors seemed happy, talks were interesting, and the after conference party was a hit.
Personally it was really amazing seeing how big the Grafana community has become and getting a chance to talk to so many users and companies
that are leveraging Grafana in unique ways. It was also great to meet some of the big Grafana contributers
like [Utkarsh Bhatnagar](https://github.com/utkarshcmu) and [Mitsuhiro Tanda](https://github.com/mtanda).

### Videos of Talks

Videos from all the talks are available on the official [Grafana Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYCwgQAMm9sTJv0rgwQLCxw).

The theater was a great place to have talks on day 1.

Day 2 talks were held in two rooms with a great view of the Hudson.

Every attendee got a Grafana scarf. The most beautiful and useful piece of swag I have ever seen (but I may be a bit biased).

It was great getting the Grafana Labs team together for the event.
