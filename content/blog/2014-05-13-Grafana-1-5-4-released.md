New release today! v1.5.4 is now available for [download](https://grafana.com/get).

Some small new features and enhancements. Check the download page for a complete changelog.

One notable change is the unsaved changes tracking. You now get a warning when moving to another dashboard without
having saved your changes, or when you close tab / window.

The progress for bigger new features and improvements has been slow. There are a number of pull requests that are wating for review. Preparation
for Monitorama PDX conference talk and the week in US has been the main reason. I have another talk at a conference next week as well which
will limit Grafana time. I currently only have evenings and weekends to spend working on Grafana.

After June that will all change. From July and onwards I will be working on Grafana and Grafana related things full time.

If you haven't noticed there is now a [live playground and demo site](http://play.grafana.org)
