New release today! v1.8.0-rc1 is now available for [download](https://grafana.com/get).

This is probably the biggest release since the first version was released. So many new features, enhancements and general UI improvements
that this will likely be a very long blog post. [play.grafana.org](http://play.grafana.org) is updated to
run 1.8.0-rc1, now with InfluxDB demo dashboards. There is also a [New features in v1.8](http://play.grafana.org/#/dashboard/db/new-features-in-v18)
dashboard that highlights some of the new features.

### Release highlights

#### 1) Mixed graph styling

You can override any display setting for a specific series using the series name or a regex pattern. Mix bars with lines, or disable
stacking for the right y-axis or any combination you can think of!

You find these options under display styles.

#### 2) Improved templating system

The templating system has been completly rewritten. This feature was previously called filtering. From 1.8 it is renamed to templating.
Templating allows you to create variables that you can use in metric queries, annotation queries and panel titles to create generic reusable
dashboards. The new templating system uses a ``$variable`` syntax, but the old ``[[variable]]`` still works.

***New templating editor***

The new templating system now has full support for InfluxDB. You can extract parts of a metric name using a regex.
You also have full control over how the "All" option should be formated so that it works for different
data sources.

InfluxDB users should use ``regex wildcard`` or ``regex values`` for the ``All`` option format.
Graphite users should use ``glob`` or ``wildcard``.

**Variables in Graphite function parameters**<br>
You can now use template variables for function parameters. There is a special template variable type called ``interval`` that includes
and auto value, where the interval is calculated based on the time range.

**Template variable selection**<br>
When selecting template variables you now get a text box and and auto complete dropdown. Useful when you have many posible values for
a variable.

#### 3) UI Improvements

**No more modals**<br>
All editors are now shown in an edit pane under the menu. This feels much more natural and faster.
All editors have also been polished and generally look a little better.

**Improved search & tags**<br>
The search results view has been given a makeover, now with colored tags.

You can navigate the search results with your up/down keys. The first
result is always highlighted. Hit enter to open the dashboard. You can add tags in the dashboard
settings edit pane. You can hit the tab key, to focus the tags link, hit enter again to get
an overview of all tags, click on the tag to filter by the tag.

#### 4) Improved Graphite Query editor

Many graphite functions can take other series as arguments. This was something the old
query editor could not handle. But the new improved query editor allows you to use
other queries as function arguments. To refer to another query you use a letter, like ``#A``.

Or a shorter version of the same thing:

![](/assets/img/blog/graphite_complex_query2.png)

This is very powerful as it allows you to reuse queries in complex expressions. For example
plot a total and a percentage. If a query is only to be used in another query and not drawn
simply hide it using the eye.

#### 5) InfluxDB Query Editor enhancements

The query editor for InfluxDB has been upgraded. There are now two rows for each query, so more space
for potentially long series names. There is now an option to add ``fill(null)`` or ``fill(0)``. These options
are very important to understand and use because they solve some important scenarios that has troubled many
InfluxDB users.

![](/assets/img/blog/influxdb_new_query_editor.png)

A setting that is very important in combination with ``fill(0)`` is the new group by time option below your
queries. This option allows you to set a fixed group by time for all queries, but more importantly it allows
you to set a lower limit for the auto group by time. When using ``fill(0)`` you do not want to insert
zeros between real measurements, so you group by time must never be below the rate of writes.

A low limit for the auto group by time is set using ``>10s`` syntax. This feature together with ``fill(0)`` is important when stacking multiple
series to ensure that every series have values for every time point.

#### 6) InfluxDB breaking changes

I am sorry to say that there are some breaking changes in 1.8 for InfluxDB users. All queries that used
a where clause or raw queries needs to be updated.

**Raw Queries**

```sql
select mean(value) from "app.status" where $timeFilter group by time($interval) fill(0) order asc
```

Raw queries are now required to include ``$timeFilter`` variable for time range, and zoom to work. Before
Grafana tried to parse and inject the time range filter in the right place, but this was fragile and could
lead to double time where conditions if there already was one in the query. Raw queries can now use,
optionally, a ``$interval`` variable which will be replaced with the auto group by time interval.

**Where condition**

In 1.7.0 you could add a single where condition, using a dropdown to select column, operation, and value.
This was overly complicated, and is now replaced with a single where condition text box where you
can enter any number of where conditions. If you open a graph in edit mode the editor will try to
patch the query (using the old model) to build the where condition for you. But you will have to
enter edit mode for this "patch" process to work.

#### 6) Misc improvements

* Url state for panel edit and fullscreen mode, copy url and you will be taken to edit or fullscreen for that panel
* from and to date range filters can be passed via url, see [Issue #787](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/787)
for more details

A full share feature, where you can share a panel or dashboard with the current time range did not
make it for this release. But will be coming.

#### 7) Documentation

The documentation for the new features and changes has yet to be done. That will be the focus for next
week. In the mean time, this blog post and the demo dashboards on [play.grafana.org](http://play.grafana.org)
will have to suffice.

#### 8) Download

Even though I have two project sponsors, it is not enough
for me to work full time and long term on Grafana. So please [pay what you think it is worth](/donate), and head to the [download](https://grafana.com/get) page
for download links and a complete changelog.

### NYC Grafana + InfluxDB Meetup on Oct 8th
I will be flying to New York on Oct 5th and will stay for two weeks. My project sponsor
[Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) will be hosting a meetup on Oct 8th where I
and Paul Dix from InfluxDB will be speaking. [Sign up](http://www.meetup.com/Monitoring-NYC/events/205947512/)
for the meetup!

### Meetups, Conferences & Company talks/coaching

If you want me to come talk about Grafana, application metrics, build measure learn or Graphite.
Please email me at [torkel@grafana.org](mailto:contact@grafana.org). I live in Stockholm Sweden so
travel could be an issue, but I am flexible and available :)

Cheers & keep on graphing!<br>
Torkel

**Big thanks to my sponsors**
