We are proud to announce the v2.6.0 stable release. This release includes a new [Table panel](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/table_panel),
an example of which you can see below.

This new flexible panel enables multiple ways for visualizing time series and logs in a tabular format. The release also includes a new InfluxDB query editor,
support for Elasticsearch pipeline aggregations, support for multiple Cloudwatch credentials and a ton of minor
fixes and improvements.

Check out the [What's New In Grafana v2.6](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/whats-new-in-v2-6) article
for more info on new features. There is also a [Demo dashboard](http://play.grafana.org/dashboard/db/new-features-in-v2-6)
at the demo site where you can play with the new panel and InfluxDB editor.
