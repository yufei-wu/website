Matt from Grafana NYC spent the week visiting Stockholm to focus on v5.0 with Torkel. Despite warnings otherwise, the weather has been beautiful, making a nice backdrop for many UX discussions. Very, very excited to soon show what we've been working on.

#### Grafana <3 Prometheus
Our very own Carl Bergquist spoke at PromCon 2017 yesterday in Munich, highlighting recent Grafana features and enhancements.

<p>We also used the opportunity to debut our coming Prometheus query editor with a load of new functionality; seems the community approves,
in fact this is our most popular tweet ever!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just revealed the coming <a href="https://twitter.com/PrometheusIO">@PrometheusIO</a> query editor with syntax highlight, function docs &amp; auto complete at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PromCon2017?src=hash">#PromCon2017</a>, check it out! <a href="https://t.co/7ZD30ltCBi">pic.twitter.com/7ZD30ltCBi</a></p>&mdash; Grafana (@grafana) <a href="https://twitter.com/grafana/status/898143069886980096">August 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

#### From the Blogosphere
- [**Wikimedia Metrics**](https://grafana.wikimedia.org): A tweet this week reminded us of the public metrics Wikimedia exposes using Grafana. Exploring the performance stats in real time for the 5th most popular site on the internet is pretty fun.

- [**Creating Grafana Annotations with InfluxDB**](https://maxchadwick.xyz/blog/grafana-influxdb-annotations): Nice short article by Max Chadwick showing how to quickly add InfluxDB as a source for Grafana annotations.

- [**LizardFS in Grafana**](https://blog.kruyt.org/lizardfs-in-grafana/): This blog post shows you how to collect metrics from LizardFS with Telegraf, store it in InfluxDB and view it in Grafana using a provided dashboard. Neat.

				ericslaw submitted his first PR to a public project this past week. Speaking from personal experience, submitting a PR can feel daunting and and we were lucky that he chose Grafana. Even the smallest contributions, like Eric fixing a bogus link within our templating has big impact.

#### Tweet of the Week
We scour Twitter each week to find an interesting/beautiful dashboard and show it off! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monitoringlove?src=hash" target="_blank">#monitoringLove</a>
<p>Seems the excitement about Prometheus and Grafana has also caught the attention of a certain superhero.
