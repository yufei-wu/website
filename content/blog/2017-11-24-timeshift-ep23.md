#### Welcome to TimeShift
This week, Grafana Labs team members in the U.S. took time off for the Thanksgiving holiday, to spend time with family and friends. While I'm thankful for many things, I would like to call out two special groups - **1. My Grafana Labs family:** you teach me something new every day, provide interesting challenges, and make our "post-geographic" company extremely collaborative. You make it a pleasure to come to work. And **2. The Grafana community:** I'm constantly impressed and amazed by the participation and passion from our community. I think I speak for the entire company when I say, "Thank you!"

#### From the Blogosphere
[**Monitoring traceroute through Prometheus and Grafana**](https://m-button.blogspot.fr/2017/11/monitoring-traceroute-through.html): There's nothing like a client-impacting outage to really make you take stock of your monitoring stack. While the author had some tools in place, he really wanted to monitor the route our packets were following. This article discusses setting up Prometheus to monitor traceroute and visualize the data in Grafana.

[**Taking KSQL for a Spin Using Real-time Device Data**](https://www.confluent.io/blog/taking-ksql-spin-using-real-time-device-data/): This article describes how to use a steering wheel/pedal set gaming device as a data source, and collect real-time driving data, displayed in a Grafana dashboard. There's also a video included demonstrating the in-game data collection.

[**Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus and Grafana**](http://blog.sluijsveld.com/23/11/2017/PrometheusMonitoring/): Chris walks us through how to gain insights in cluster and pod performance on your Kubernetes workloads in Azure using Prometheus and Grafana.

[**Scaling out Grafana with Kubernetes and AWS**](https://medium.com/@fcgravalos/scaling-out-grafana-with-kubernetes-and-aws-62745257df10): Fernando discusses inexpensive horizontal scaling of Grafana and how to deploy multiple replicas using Kubernetes and AWS.

[**Graphite Metrics Stack with Jason Dixon and Dan Cech â€“ Episode 136**](https://www.podcastinit.com/graphite-metrics-with-jason-dixon-and-dan-cech-episode-136/): In this Podcast, Grafana Labs Director, Platform Services Dan Cech, sat down with fellow Graphite maintainer Jason Dixon to discuss Graphite's architecture, challenges as the project has evolved, Graphite's staying power over the years, and what we can expect in future versions.

[**Scripted Grafana Dashboards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztRP1CJjcWs): This video covers scripted dashboards, which dynamically generates dashboards using Javascript. Scripted dashboards can be more flexible and convenient if you have a lot of metric names that change; instead of always designing your dashboard through the UI, generate them with code.

[**GitLab Performance Monitoring with Grafana**](https://hackernoon.com/gitlab-performance-monitoring-with-grafana-a2394848d071): Mohamed provides a comprehensive look at Gitlab Performance Monitoring, which has been available since Gitlab v8.4. He's also included a dashboard to get you up and visualizing quickly.
