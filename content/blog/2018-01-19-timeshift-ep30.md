### Welcome to TimeShift
We're only 6 weeks away from the next GrafanaCon and here at Grafana Labs we're buzzing with excitement. We have some great talks lined up that you won't want to miss. 

This week's TimeShift covers Grafana's annotation functionality, monitoring with Prometheus, integrating Grafana with NetFlow and a peek inside Stream's monitoring stack. Enjoy!

I really don't want to be on call, should I? Is Docker the right place for my code or am I better of just going straight to Serverless? And why should I care about any of it? I'll try to answer some of these questions while looking at what DevOps really is about and how commodisation of servers through "the cloud" ties into it all. This session will be an opinionated piece from a developer who's been on-call for the past 6 years and would like to convince you to do the same, at least once.

By the end of this talk, weâ€™ll better understand how each of Logging, Metrics and Distributed Tracing aids us in different ways to understand our applications.

The powerful open-source OpenNMS software monitors a network, including all connected devices, and provides logging of a variety of data that can be used for analysis and planning purposes. In our next OpenNMS webinar on February 21, 2018, we introduce "Grafana" - a web-based tool for creating and displaying dashboards from various data sources, which can be perfectly combined with OpenNMS.
