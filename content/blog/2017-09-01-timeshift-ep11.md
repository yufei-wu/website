September is here and summer is officially drawing to a close, but the Grafana team has stayed busy. We're prepping for an upcoming Grafana 4.5 release, had some new and updated plugins, and would like to thank two contributors for fixing a non-obvious bug. Also - The <a href="http://grafana.com/grafanacon-cfp?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_11" target="_blank">CFP for GrafanaCon EU</a> is open, and we'd like you to speak!

#### From the Blogosphere
[**Zabbix, Grafana and Python, a Match Made in Heaven**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/zabbix-grafana-python-match-made-heaven-david-ribeiro-lopes): David's article, published earlier this year, hits on some great points about open source software and how you don't have to spend much (or any) money to get valuable monitoring for your infrastructure.

[**The Business of Democratizing Metrics**](https://www.packet.net/customers/grafana/): Our friends over at <a href="https://www.packet.net/" target="_blank">Packet</a> stopped by the office recently to sit down and chat with the Grafana Labs co-founders. They discussed how Grafana started, how monitoring has evolved, and democratizing metrics.

[**Visualizing CloudWatch with Grafana**](http://dev.classmethod.jp/cloud/aws/visualizing-cloudwatch-with-grafana/): Yuzo put together an article outlining his first experience adding a CloudWatch data source in Grafana, importing his first dashboard, then comparing the graphs between Grafana and CloudWatch.

[**Monitoring Linux performance with Grafana**](https://opensource.com/article/17/8/linux-grafana): Jim wanted to monitor his CentOS home router to get network traffic and disk usage stats, but wanted to try something different than his previous cacti monitoring. This walkthrough shows how he set things up to collect, store and visualize the data.

[**Visualizing Jenkins Pipeline Results in Grafana**](https://piotrminkowski.wordpress.com/2017/08/29/visualizing-jenkins-pipeline-results-in-grafana/): Piotr provides a walkthrough of his setup and configuration to view Jenkins build results for his continuous delivery environment in Grafana.

#### Grafana Plugins
This week we've added a plugin for the new time series database Sidewinder, and updates to the Carpet Plot graph panel. If you haven't installed a plugin, it's easy. For on-premises installations, the Grafana-cli will do the work for you. If you're using <a href="https://grafana.com/cloud/grafana?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=timeshift_11" target="_blank">Hosted Grafana</a>, you can install any plugin with one click.

#### Tweet of the Week
We scour Twitter each week to find an interesting/beautiful dashboard and show it off! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/monitoringlove?src=hash" target="_blank">#monitoringLove</a>
<p>Nice! Combining different panel types on a dashboard can add more context to your data - Looks like a very functional dashboard.</p>
