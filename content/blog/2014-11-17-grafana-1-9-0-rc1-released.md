New release today! v1.9.0-rc1 is now available for [download](https://grafana.com/get).

[play.grafana.org](http://play.grafana.org) is updated to run 1.9.0-rc1.
There is also a [New features in v1.9](http://play.grafana.org/#/dashboard/db/new-features-in-v19)
dashboard that highlights some of the new features.

No breaking changes, so update should be problem free. But this is a release candidate so
there could be some bugs.

### Release highlights

#### 1) Singlestat panel

This release marks the introduction of a new panel!

A multitude of options makes this panel pretty flexible.

* Add sparkline to the bottom of the panel
* Add text before/after the value
* Add color thresholds for the value or the panel background
* Control font size
* Adding a panel link makes the whole panel act as a link to another dashboard

#### 2) Share panel feature
Click on panel title area (anywhere works, does not need to be the title text) to open the
new panel menu. Click on the ``share`` button to open the new share dialog. In this dialog
you get a URL to that panel with the current time range and any template variables
embedded in the URL.

#### 3) Fill below to
An new series specific style has been added in this release that is very
useful when visualizing max/min as shadow behind an average.

This display style is specified by adding a series override rule for the series
above (ex. max). The value of the option is the series name to fill to (ex min).

Example:

#### 4) Other graph features & enhancements

* Shared tooltip option, shows every series when hovering
* Toggle legend from panel menu
* Improved legend table mode look
* Sort legend series (only works in table mode)
* Multi graph crosshair line (shows a vertical red line where you hover on all graphs)

#### 5) Panel links
In the General tab you can now add links to other dashboards or absolute links
to other web apps. These links can then be accessed from the panel menu. Links
to other dashboards will preserve the current time range.

You access these links from the panel menu dropdown. The whole singlestat panel
will act as link if a drilldown / detail link is added to the panel.
